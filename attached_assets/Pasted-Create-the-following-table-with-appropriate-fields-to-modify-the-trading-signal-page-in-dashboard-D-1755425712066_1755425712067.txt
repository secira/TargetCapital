Create the following table with appropriate fields to modify the trading signal page in dashboard. Data should come from this table. This table will be created by admin on a daily basis and user will be browsing and making trading decision. Since there will be date for every day, we will need a date picker to display today signals or go back and see past signals for reference. We can organize the trading signals page by Stocks, Options, Futures, Currency, Mutual Funds, Crypto and Commodities. First user will select the date, for each date we can display each asset class.
