
“Trade Now”  page in dashboard. 

Create the following tables with appropriate fields to modify the Trade Now page in dashboard. Data should come from this table. This table will be created by admin on a daily basis and user will be browsing and making trading decision. Since there will be date for every day, we will need a date picker to display today signals or go back and see past signals for reference. We can organize the trading signals page by Stocks, Options, Futures. First user will select the date, for each date we can display each asset class. Update the “Trade Now” to take data from these tables and list the strategies for execution.

Here is a comprehensive table structure for an algo trading platform supporting multiple strategies—Straddle, Strangle, Butterfly, Covered Calls, Naked Calls—with live execution across multiple brokers. This schema is optimized for algorithmic setups, modular strategy tracking, multi-leg positions, and automated order routing.

Relationships:
•	Each Strategy can have multiple AlgoRuns (executions).
•	Each AlgoRun can have multiple Positions.
•	Each Position (multi-leg) supports legs (calls/puts/stocks)—suitable for complex options strategies.
•	Leg orders are routed and tracked via multiple Brokers.
•	Orders table allows order level auditing and low-level error handling—important for algo trading automation.
 
This schema supports:
•	Modular expansion for more strategies.
•	Clean separation between strategies, executions, positions, and brokers.
•	Real-time, multi-broker, multi-leg order management and performance analytics—ideal for advanced algo trading setups.
Let me know if you need further normalization, API route suggestions, or sample data inserts for specific strategies!
