### System Architecture
The platform features a multi-service backend with Flask for the web interface and FastAPI for high-performance trading operations. It uses WebSockets for real-time data, Celery with Redis for background tasks, and PostgreSQL with Redis caching for data storage. A multi-tenant architecture ensures tenant isolation via `tenant_id` and middleware for resolution. The frontend uses Jinja2, Bootstrap 5.3.0, Font Awesome 6.4.0, Google Fonts (Inter), and vanilla JavaScript, focusing on a mobile-first, responsive design with clean white backgrounds and modern typography.

**AI Architecture**:
Target Capital employs a dual AI engine approach:
-   **Anthropic Workflow Engine** (fully implemented): Uses `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` as primary model and `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` as fallback. Implementation files:
    - `services/anthropic_service.py` — Claude API wrapper with retry logic, structured output, and tool-use support
    - `services/workflow_engine.py` — Base framework: `WorkflowNode`, `WorkflowPipeline`, `WorkflowState`, audit trails
    - `services/data_connectors.py` — Pluggable `B2CConnector`, `B2BConnector`, `DatabaseConnector` with `ConnectorRegistry`
    - `services/workflow_iscore.py` — 7-node I-Score pipeline (data collection → qualitative → quantitative → sentiment → trend → aggregation → storage)
    - `services/workflow_research.py` — 5-step research pipeline (query understanding → context → market analysis → response → trade suggestions)
    - `services/workflow_portfolio.py` — 6-step portfolio analysis (fetch → risk → sector → allocation → opportunities → report)
    - `routes_workflow.py` — REST endpoints: `/api/workflow/iscore`, `/api/workflow/research`, `/api/workflow/portfolio`, `/api/workflow/executions`, `/api/workflow/connectors`
    - `templates/dashboard/workflows/workflow_hub.html` — Visual pipeline execution UI with step-by-step progress, results display, and execution history
    - Database models: `WorkflowExecution`, `WorkflowStep`, `DataConnectorConfig` in `models.py`
    - Blueprint `workflow_bp` registered in `main.py`
    - Sidebar nav: accessible via Research Co-Pilot (no separate menu item)
-   **LangGraph Engine**: The original OpenAI-based system, featuring a `LangGraph Research Assistant`, a `Multi-Agent Portfolio Optimizer`, a `Smart Trading Signal Pipeline`, and a `Trade Plus Pipeline`. Visualizations are provided through a `Visual Agent Workflow System`, with state persistence via PostgreSQL models.

**B2B/B2C Multi-Tenant Data Architecture**: Supports B2C user-connected brokers (Dhan, Zerodha, Angel) via `BrokerService` and B2B partner broker APIs with configurable `B2BConnector`. A database fallback reads from the local `Portfolio` model. Each B2B partner operates as a distinct tenant.

**Key Features & Design Patterns**:
-   **Agentic AI Tools**: Leverages OpenAI, Perplexity, and LangGraph for advanced analytics.
-   **Multi-Broker Integration**: Unified API support for 12 major Indian brokers.
-   **Authentication**: Google OAuth, Mobile OTP, and Email/Password.
-   **RAG-Powered Research Assistant**: Semantic search with pgvector, LLM responses with citations.
-   **Multi-Asset Portfolio System**: Supports 11 asset classes across multiple brokers with real-time data and asset-specific filtering.
-   **Portfolio Asset Vector Embeddings**: Automatic generation for semantic search and AI analysis.
-   **Unified Portfolio Analyzer System**: AI-powered analysis with multi-agent LangGraph optimization and risk profiling.
-   **Scentric Risk Engine** (`services/risk_engine.py`): Portfolio Pulse (health score, alerts), Risk Heat Map (per-asset-class risk/weight/PnL grid), Goal-Based Monitoring (progress bars vs financial goals). Displayed on the Portfolio page. `PortfolioEvent` model tracks all events.
-   **Behavioural Guardrails** (Trade Now page): Live client-side guardrail checks trigger when selecting assets — warns against risk profile violations (conservative user picking derivatives) and concentration risk (>20% portfolio in one trade).
-   **Comprehensive Trading Signal System**: LangGraph-powered signal pipeline with validation and execution planning.
-   **Subscription Model**: Tiered access (FREE, TARGET PLUS, TARGET PRO, HNI).
-   **Knowledge Base**: Educational trading articles.

**Mobile App & PWA Support**:
-   **Mobile REST API (v1)**: Versioned API `/api/v1/mobile/` with JWT authentication.
-   **JWT Authentication**: Stateless token-based authentication.
-   **Mobile Endpoints**: Covers authentication, portfolio, trading signals, brokers, and market data.
-   **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Full PWA support including service worker, offline caching, and push notifications.
-   **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive UI with touch optimization.

**Enterprise Multi-Tenant Security Architecture**: Implements defense-in-depth through:
1.  **SQLAlchemy ORM Automatic Filtering**: Auto-injects tenant filters and validates `tenant_id` for data isolation.
2.  **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Dynamic RLS policy creation using `current_setting('app.tenant_id')`.
3.  **Per-Tenant Encryption Service**: Hierarchical key management and Fernet-based field-level encryption for sensitive data.

**Application Security Controls**:
-   **User Data Isolation**: Queries filtered by `user_id` and `tenant_id`, URL manipulation protection via `verify_resource_ownership()`.
-   **API Keys & Secrets Protection**: Environment variables for keys, encrypted broker credentials, Replit/Railway secrets management, rate limiting.
-   **Privilege Escalation Prevention**: `is_admin` and `pricing_plan` fields cannot be user-modified, `@admin_required` decorator, subscription changes via verified webhooks.

**I-Score Engine Implementation**: A fully functional 7-node LangGraph workflow using GPT-4 Turbo, Perplexity Sonar Pro, and NSE Service for weighted scoring based on Qualitative, Quantitative/Technical, Search/Sentiment, and Trend Analysis. Includes cache checks, real-time market data, detailed reasoning, and result storage.
