## Admin Dashboard Integration

Once configured, the admin dashboard will show:
- ✅ Green checkmark for configured platforms
- ❌ Red X for unconfigured platforms
- Auto-sharing options when creating new signals
- Sharing history and delivery status

## Troubleshooting

### WhatsApp Issues
- **403 Forbidden**: Check if your access token is valid
- **Invalid Phone Number**: Ensure phone number ID is correct
- **Group Not Found**: Verify group chat ID and bot permissions

### Telegram Issues
- **Bot Not Found**: Check if bot token is correct
- **Chat Not Found**: Verify channel ID format and bot admin permissions
- **Message Too Long**: Telegram has a 4096 character limit

### Common Solutions
1. **Rate Limits**: Both platforms have rate limits. Don't send too many messages quickly.
2. **Permissions**: Ensure your bot has admin permissions in groups/channels.
3. **Environment Variables**: Double-check all environment variables are set correctly.

## Production Considerations

### WhatsApp Business API
- Free tier has limitations (1000 messages/month)
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for production use
- Set up webhooks for two-way communication

### Telegram Bot
- Free with generous limits
- Consider using inline keyboards for user interaction
- Set up webhooks for real-time message handling

### Security
- Keep API tokens secure and rotate them regularly
- Use environment variables, never hardcode credentials
- Monitor API usage and set up alerts for errors

## Support

If you need help setting up:
1. Check the error logs in the admin dashboard
2. Run the test configuration script
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test with a simple message first
